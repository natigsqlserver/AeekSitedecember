                    <p>
                        E-mobility refers to the use of electric vehicles and partly enables the transition from
                        fuel-powered transport to cleaner transport options that have less impact on the environment.
                        Green energy is aimed at the creation and use of clean energy sources that are renewable and do
                        little harm to the environment.
                        In this way, E-mobility technologies and Green energy technologies are based on complementary
                        technologies, and the keystone of these technologies is to protect the environment and reduce
                        fuel dependence, and serve the implementation of the relevant goals of the Sustainable
                        Development Goals. Therefore, both technologies are considered together and given E-Mobility and
                        Green Energy Technologies as the main activity direction.
                        The activity in this direction is aimed at the following directions:
