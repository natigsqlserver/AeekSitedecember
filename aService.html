                        Digital production technologies change traditional production processes and enable the
                        development
                        of
                        innovative products faster and more efficiently, and play a key role in the concept of Industry

                        Additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer, often using materials such as plastics,
                        metals
                        and
                        ceramics. It enables rapid prototyping, customization, and the creation of complex geometries
                        that
                        would be difficult or impossible using traditional manufacturing methods.

                        It is important to build intelligent systems using digital technologies, including the
                        organization
                        of
                        industrial robotization and automatic control. At the same time, building a system for this
                        process
                        can
                        be integrated into production equipment to collect various data (quality, environment, safety,
                        etc.).
                        On the other hand, it is important to establish and start up technical services for the
                        exploitation
                        and
                        restoration of digital technologies.
